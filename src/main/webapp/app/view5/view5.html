    <h2>Strategy for assigning tasks to group members</h2>
    During the week, we held a 5-10 minutes meeting where we talked about what had been made the day before and what 
    have been achieved and not achieved. By this dialog, we made a plan for the day.
    Each group member has had a primary task but all members has had been invovled.
